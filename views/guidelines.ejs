        <div class="class12345">
            <hr>
        </div>
        <p> We expect everyone on SetItUp to treat each other respectfully, with kindness and compassion. We do not tolerate
            hateful, hurtful, or harassing content on SetItUp. &nbsp;We consider unsolicited sexual content and messages to
            be sexual harassment. <strong> We don't like jerks, so please don't be a jerk.&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p> Here's the thing. We want you to think about this one rule: <em>treat online interactions as you would even if
                they were offline.&nbsp;</em></p>
        <ul>
            <li>When sending messages, consider what you would say to someone who you just met at a club or coffee
                shop.&nbsp;</li>
            <li>When uploading photos, consider if the same pose or outfit would be appropriate in public.&nbsp;</li>
            <li>When creating a profile, consider if you'd feel comfortable having a family member or friend read it.&nbsp;
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p> SetItUp is not a magical place where people want to hear about your sexual fantasies out of the blue, or where
            you can be mean to someone with no repercussions. Treat it as a place where you can talk to other humans about
            things that matter to you both, and remember that the best way to make a meaningful connection with someone is
            to treat them well.</p>
        <p> <br> Below are our community guidelines and moderation standards. If you see anyone who violates these
            guidelines, please report&nbsp;them to us
            right away.</p>
        <h3 id="harassing" class="weight">Harassment</h3>
        <div class="class12345">
            <hr>
        </div>
        <p> If you wouldn’t say it to someone you just met in person, you shouldn’t be saying it online. Messages should be
            respectful, appropriate, honest, and kind. We don't tolerate "negging" (insulting statements disguised as
            "flirting") or other rude behavior. This expectation also includes interactions with SetItUp staff. People found
            to be sending harassing messages will be banned.</p>
        <p> Additionally, profile content itself should also be respectful and kind. Profile essays which are found to be
            overly combative or hateful may be removed or may even result in your profile being banned.</p>
        <h3 id="sexual" class="weight">Sexual Harassment / Explicit Sexual Content</h3>
        <div class="class12345">
            <hr>
        </div>
        <p> Exposing other people to your sexual fantasies without their consent is rude and inappropriate, and it's not
            what most people on SetItUp are looking for. If your profile is reported to us as sexually explicit or
            offensive, it will be banned. This includes kink/ fetish profiles, profiles describing which sex acts they are
            looking for, etc.&nbsp;</p>
        <p> We also do not allow unwanted sexually explicit messages on SetItUp. This includes descriptions of sexual acts/
            kinks/ fetishes, sexualized comments about people's photos, etc. &nbsp;Even if someone says they are open to
            hookups on their profile, it does NOT mean they want sexually explicit messages.</p>
        <p> Finally, we do not allow sexually explicit photos or nudity.</p>
        <p> We consider this to be sexual harassment and will ban any offenders that are reported to us.</p>
        <h3 id="hate" class="weight">Hate</h3>
        <div class="class12345">
            <hr>
        </div>
        <p> We take the truth of everyone’s inalienable rights very seriously. Our belief in them has acted as our
            inspiration since our founding. We proudly stand rooted in inclusivity. There is no room for hate
            in a place where you’re looking for love.&nbsp;</p>
        <p> Any content (including in profiles and messages) that promotes or condones racism, bigotry, violence, hate,
            dehumanization, or harm against individuals or groups based on things like race, ethnicity, disability, age,
            nationality, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, religion, appearance, or occupation/association with a
            group is strictly forbidden and may result in you being permanently banned. This includes but is not limited to:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Symbols of hate groups in photos, racist or offensive memes, etc.</li>
            <li>Hateful slurs, offensive statements, coded language, dog whistles, or references to being a member of a hate
                group</li>
            <li>Giving approval&nbsp;(even tacit)&nbsp;or statements of support towards a hate group or their ideals</li>
            <li>It also includes your reports to SetItUp staff: if you flag a profile for no other reason than being trans,
                for example, it may result in your own profile being banned.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="violent " class="weight">Violent or Graphic Content</h3>
        <div class="class12345">
            <hr>
        </div>
        <p> We do not allow any content in photos, profiles, or messages that is threatening, incites violence, contains
            graphic or gratuitous violence or gore, or is&nbsp;disturbing or otherwise inappropriate for a dating site. This
            does also include depictions of self harm which can in turn be harmful for others to see. This content will be
            removed and may also get you banned. &nbsp;</p>
        <h3 id="names" class="weight">Profile names and profile text</h3>
        <div class="class12345">
            <hr>
        </div>
        <p> We consider your profile's display name&nbsp;and your profile text to be similar to a first message or first
            impression to other members of the site: we expect both to be respectful and appropriate. If your profile text
            or name could be seen as offensive, hateful, obscene, or clearly trolling, we will take moderation action, up to
            and including banning your profile. <br> <br> Your listed name&nbsp;should be the name you like to go by. It can
            be your first name, your initials, or a nickname- all are fine. It does not have to be the full name
            on&nbsp;your birth certificate! We do not check listed names against any kind of ID, and we trust people to
            enter names they'd like to go by themselves.&nbsp;That said, we will still moderate based on names if&nbsp;they
            include offensive or obscene language, or make a profile appear to be fake (i.e. using a celebrity name instead
            of your own).</p>
        <h3 id="unique" class="weight">Unique and bona fide profile</h3>
        <div class="class12345">
            <hr>
        </div>
        <p> You must create only one unique profile. In addition, your use of SetItUp must&nbsp;be for bona fide
            relationship-seeking purposes (for example, you may not use SetItUp solely to compile a report of compatible
            singles in your area, to find people to join a club or group activity, or to write a school research paper).</p>
        <h3 id="fake" class="weight">Fake Accounts</h3>
        <div class="class12345">
            <hr>
        </div>
        <p> We do not tolerate any kind of fake accounts on SetItUp. Your profile must be really of you, and must be for
            dating purposes.</p>
        <p> Creating a fake account will get your main account as well as the fake account(s) banned.&nbsp; <br> <br> Also,
            your profile details such as age, height, location, etc. must be accurate. We restrict searching and showing
            profiles based on mutual fit for details like age, location, gender, and orientation for a reason: so that you
            can find a person who is looking for someone just like you.&nbsp;Changing these details&nbsp;to appear in
            searches that you would not otherwise&nbsp;is not allowed and will result in your profile being
            banned.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <h3 id="solicitation " class="weight">Solicitation</h3>
        <div class="class12345">
            <hr>
        </div>
        <p> Using SetItUp for commercial solicitation or exchange of money is prohibited. Do not share your own financial
            information (PayPal, Venmo, Amazon wishlist, etc.) for the purpose of receiving money or goods from other
            members. Do not attempt to get other member's financial or other private information. &nbsp;</p>
        <p> Do not send messages or create accounts for the purpose of driving members to a business or external site. This
            includes&nbsp;recruiting people for a hobby or activity if it's&nbsp;not for dating purposes.&nbsp; <br> <br> We
            also do not allow references to sugar daddy/baby dating, asking for gifts to date, wanting to be $poiled, etc,
            or phrases like "Send me $5 and see what happens" on your profile. This all falls under solicitation of
            money/goods and is not allowed.&nbsp;</p>
        <p> Likewise, we also do not allow offers of money for sex, sugar daddies, acceptance of solicitation offers,
            etc.&nbsp;</p>
        <p> Doing any of these will get you banned.</p>
        <h3 id="contact" class="weight">Contact information&nbsp;</h3>
        <div class="class12345">
            <hr>
        </div>
        <p> We do not allow anyone to&nbsp;post private information for public display, including their own private
            information, but especially other people's. Violations of other people's privacy will result in a ban.</p>
        <p> It's always good to be cautious when exchanging contact info. A sign of a scammer, fake account, or someone up
            to no good is when they are in a hurry to give you their offsite contact info too quickly. This could be because
            they want to get you away from SetItUp so they can continue talking with you even after we ban them, or they are
            sharing someone else's contact info to get revenge on them.&nbsp;</p>
        <p> Don’t give your phone number out too quickly - If you keep communication on the dating site, then you are much
            more protected. If the user is discovered to be a scammer or has other bad&nbsp;reports against them then you
            may see the profile disappear quickly-- this is likely because we've banned them. If a user vanishes and
            re-appears under another name, that is a very very bad sign. We ban people for good reasons. If you have given
            them your phone number or email address too quickly then you won’t see if we have banned them.</p>
        <p> If something seems strange about the way someone is exchanging contact info, or if they are displaying a phone
            number or email address prominently on their profile or photos, please report.&nbsp;</p>
        <h3 id="illegal" class="weight">Illegal behavior</h3>
        <div class="class12345">
            <hr>
        </div>
        <p> It should go without saying, but discussion or promotion of anything illegal is not allowed and will result in
            getting you banned. This includes illegal sexual acts, drug dealing, fraud, threats, or anything else that is
            against the law. We do not tolerate any kind of discussion about underage sex.</p>
        <h3 id="minors" class="weight">Minors / under 15</h3>
        <div class="class12345">
            <hr>
        </div>
        <p> You must be 15 to use SetItUp. We do not allow minors to use SetItUp.&nbsp;Although all profiles only allow you
            to enter an age over 15, sometimes&nbsp;people will lie about their age. If you suspect a profile of being made
            by someone who is under 15, please report them to us.&nbsp; <br> <br> If we find someone to be knowingly
            engaging in inappropriate conversation with someone who has revealed themselves to be under 15, we will also ban
            that profile.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Photos should include your face (profile photo album), or be pictures you've taken (elsewhere).&nbsp;</li>
            <li>We do not allow any photos with nudity&nbsp;or explicitly sexual content.</li>
            <li>We also do not allow any hateful imagery (white power/ nazi images, racist meme photos, etc). This will get
                you banned. Any photos of anything overly violent, offensive, illegal, disturbing, or otherwise
                inappropriate for a dating site will be removed and may also get you banned. &nbsp;</li>
            <li>Photos with contact information on them (including phone number, email address, kik, Facebook address, etc)
                will be removed. Repeated violation of this rule or other suspicious behavior may result in the profile
                being blocked as well.&nbsp;</li>
            <li>Photos of you as a kid, or of your kids but without you in the photo as well will be removed.</li>
            <li>For multiple offenses or extreme cases, profiles may also be banned and removed.</li>
        </ul>
        <p> If a photo is removed you will be emailed and told that this has happened and warned that repeated offenses
            might get you banned. This warning isn't a fake one, and we will ban your account for multiple infractions.</p>
        <h3 id="offsite" class="weight">Offsite behavior</h3>
        <div class="class12345">
            <hr>
        </div>
        <p> We do ban for extreme offsite behavior. Please report any instances of offsite abuse, assault, harassment,
            stalking, theft, or anything else illegal or that makes you feel unsafe. (Note: we will not tell the person
            you're reporting to us that you have reported them or why they were reported).</p>
        <p> In these cases, we encourage you to reach out to law enforcement as well, who we will cooperate with where
            needed. &nbsp;</p>
        <h3 id="reporting" class="weight">Reporting</h3>
        <div class="class12345">
            <hr>
        </div>
        <p> Please help us by reporting anything or anyone that does not follow our community guidelines.&nbsp;</p>
        <p> <strong>A note on false reporting:<br> </strong>In some cases we will ban an account if we've found it to be
            creating false reports against other users. This includes flagging/reporting trans or nonbinary users for no
            reason other than their gender or orientation, false/ made up reports of bad behavior, etc.&nbsp;</p>
        <p> <strong>A final note:<br> </strong>While our community guidelines cover most instances of moderator action, it
            is not an exhaustive list, and we do retain the right to ban
            anyone from SetItUp for any reason if we see fit.</p>
